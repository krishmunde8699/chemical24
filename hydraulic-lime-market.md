 The global Hydraulic Lime market was valued at US$ 154.7 million in 2023 and is projected to reach US$ 335.8 million by 2030, at a CAGR of 7.5% during the forecast period.

Hydraulic lime is a type of lime used in construction that can set under water, making it suitable for applications where traditional lime cannot be used. Its hydraulic properties come from the clay and other impurities mixed with lime during production. Hydraulic lime is categorized into two main types: Natural Hydraulic Lime (NHL) and Artificial Hydraulic Lime (AHL). This analysis explores the global production and consumption trends of hydraulic lime, examining regional dynamics, market drivers, challenges, and future outlooks.
